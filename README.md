# mini-game

My app, a fun twist on The Odin Project’s to-do list, turns task management into
a simple game. Guide a character to a task board, press 'E' to add tasks, and
manage them effortlessly. With walking, running, jumping, and clicking to
attack, it’s a lighthearted way to relax, wander, and plan tasks for later.

P.S. Might introduce object colisions and enemy attack features with short story sometime in future, but that would be another project most likely, I was thinking to choose React framework for coding it because it follows certain structure which is easier to manage, maintain & scale.

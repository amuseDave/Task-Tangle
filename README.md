# mini-game

My app, a fun twist on The Odin Project’s to-do list, turns task management into
a simple game. Guide a character to a task board, press 'E' to add tasks, and
manage them effortlessly. With walking, running, jumping, and clicking to
attack, it’s a lighthearted way to relax, wander, and plan tasks for later.
